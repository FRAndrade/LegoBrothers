#Winter Challenge

For the [Winter Challenge XIV 2018](https://www.robocore.net/eventos/wc14), we used basic ramp/ram weapons, and the LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Software.

# Software
Both robots' software was built on [LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Software v.1.31](https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/downloads/download-software). You shouldn't have problems to run any of the three programs on  `src/` or in a version equal or greater than that.

The three programs are `/LISTEN`, `/WINTER_Z` and `/two_eyes`, all in mindstorm format. The LISTEN program listens for enemies' ultrassonic waves (it will not work against infrared-equipped opponents), and the WINTER_Z and two_eyes programs follow a seek-and-destroy behaviour and are very similar, however the two_eyes program worked fine in tests, on the day of the competition it showed some inconsistencies, so we revamped it into the WINTER_Z program.

# Mechanics
The mechanics's part of this robot were built primarily using [LEGO MINDSTORMS® set](https://shop.lego.com/en-US/LEGO-MINDSTORMS-EV3-31313), 
but not limited to it. The table below lists some of the components used in **Astrogildo** and **Biruleibe**.
